Pure Them for TWITTER BOOTSTRAP
=================

Pure theme is a clean theam with several subtle textures that really give the bootstrap framework an amazing look and feal.


Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, Pure theme will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the follow format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch

For more information on SemVer, please visit http://semver.org/.
